h2. Bloggy, the hacker's choice blogging system

TODO:
* New visual look
* New about page
* [MAYBE] More features

(This readme markdown worked :D)

Explaining how this works:
Bloggy is a simple blog system that grabs posts from the posts/ folder. These posts are named post1.html and so on. The posts are edited using any HTML editor.
Guidelines for editing posts:

1 Write the content in HTML			
2 Save the file as post<number>.html	
3 Reload the blog						
3 Is magical!
								
Explaining the tags: 																	
* <h1> is the date tag																	
* <sup> in the <h1> is the ordinal number, by example: 12th								
* <h2> is the post's title															
* <p> is the content 																	
REMEMBER IN <p> YOU CAN WRITE ANY KIND OF HTML! 										
For making images appear in the lightbox, set the rel= tag to facebox, rel="facebox"
